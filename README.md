<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Example Screenshot](docs/SheetAbleShowcase.png)


**SheetAble** is an easy to use music sheet organiser for all the music enthusiasts out there. Currently the only client is on the web, but the goal was from the beginning on to have SheetAble available on all devices with the functionality to make notes onto your pdfs and have them stored on your home server. It is still consultation if there should be a Desktop app ontop of the Website as a further client.
